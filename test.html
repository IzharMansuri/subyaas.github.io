                        In the heart of a bustling Rajasthani village, where the sun kisses stone and tradition whispers through the air, a quiet revolution in art is unfolding. Here, over 200 skilled artisans rise with the dawn, their hands weathered by time yet steady with purpose. They don't just work with marble—they breathe life into it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hero-text">
                        Each block of stone arrives blank and silent. But in the workshop, under the rhythmic tap of chisels and the careful sweep of fingers, it begins to speak. One artisan etches the curves of a goddess, while another sculpts the sleek lines of a modern form. Their work is more than craft; it's the weaving of past and present, legacy and innovation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hero-text">
                        Generations of knowledge pass through each hand. A grandfather trains his grandson not only in skill, but in reverence—for the stone, the art, and the heritage. This is more than employment; it's a sanctuary where culture is preserved and dignity restored through creation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hero-text">
                        Every sculpture that leaves the studio carries a story—not just of the marble, but of the soul that shaped it. From temples to modern homes, our pieces are timeless bridges, connecting tradition to the future with elegance and authenticity.
